## The new norm of zoonosis.

[Zoonotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosis) pandemics and epidemics are slowly becoming a ubiquitous feature of the 21st century lifestyle. A number of factors are often blamed for that. First, is the increased globalization of travel and trade. This naturally implies increased contact between people and goods from different parts of the world. The second factor is environmental, mainly encroachment into previously untouched natural habitats and climate change. These two are presumed to have an effect on the ecological balance and the distribution and reproduction of vectors. And lastly is the collapse of human and animal health infrastructure, especially in the developing world. This is just but not an exhaustive list. All these help to facilitate the easy emergence, re-emergence and spreading of these zoonosis. Effects are likely to exacerbate as countries continue to urbanize and people become more and more reliant on animal protein for sustenance.

Calls for robust [ONE HEALTH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Health) approaches have never been louder with some institutions already in place. One question still lingers: How prepared are we to deal with these zoonosis? Such a question has no better augmenting that the recent spate of COVID-19 and monkey pox globally. There have been also recent reports of new cases of [Ebola in Uganda]( https://www.thecitizen.co.tz/tanzania/news/africa/uganda-ebola-outbreak-here-s-what-you-need-to-know-3962448). How the effects of these zoonosis will be distributed and borne across societies, especially during this period of global economic meltdown, though seemingly straightforward, remains a subject of economic inquiry.

## The scourge of animal diseases is real.

Developing countries continue to suffer the brunt of emerging and re-emerging animal diseases.These effects are not only confined to the livestock value chains.In some instances, the effects cascade to sectors that appear completely unrelated to livestock production.A typical case here is of [Foot and Mouth disease outbreak in South Africa disrupting citrus exports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-16/south-africa-bans-movement-of-cattle-to-curb-disease-outbreak).This attest to the need for countries to take investments in bio-security more seriously.
